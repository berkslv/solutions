# 94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal

Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

 

### Example 1:

```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
```


### Example 2:

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```


###Â Example 3:

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
```
