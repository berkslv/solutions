Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:
 - Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
 - Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
 

### Example 1:

```
Input: s = "()"
Output: true
```


### Example 2:

```
Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true
```


### Example 3:

```
Input: s = "(]"
Output: false
```
