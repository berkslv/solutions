# 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

 

### Example 1:

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
```


### Example 2:

```
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
```
