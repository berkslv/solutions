# 110. Balanced Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:

a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.

### Example 1:

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: true
```


### Example 2:

```
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]
Output: false
```


### Example 3:
